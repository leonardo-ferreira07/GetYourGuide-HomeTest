# GetYourGuide HomeTest

Application developed for an application to Senior iOS Engineer position at GetYourGuide.

## Requirements:

- Xcode 10.3;
- iOS 12.4;
- Swift 5;
- Cocoapods (as the project only have one small dependency, I've commited it to the repository, so you should be able to run the project without having Cocoapods to install the dependency);

## Installation:

- Open the project directory;
- Run `pod install` to install the dependency via Cocoapods (it should not be necessary as the `/Pods` folder is commited to the repository;
- Open the `GetYourGuide.xcworkspace` file to be able to run the project;

## Third-party libraries:
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - Framework written in pure-Swift code for downloading and caching images from the web (I used this to load the profile images from reviewers, the ones that have a profile image);
